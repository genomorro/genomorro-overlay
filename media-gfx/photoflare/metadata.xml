    This  is   an  effort   to  bring  quick,   simple  but  powerful   image  editing   to  the
    masses. Photoflare  is inspired by  the image editor  currently only available  on Microsoft
    Windows â€“ PhotoFiltre. However, it will not be  a straight clone. It is being built from the
    ground up to be much improved and cross platform too!
